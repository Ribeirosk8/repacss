      <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400">
        The <span class="text-primary dark:text-primary-light">Renewable Energy Powered Advanced Computing Systems and Services (REPACSS)</span> project envisions reducing the carbon footprint of large-scale scientific computing by developing innovative methods and tools. Over five years, the project aims to demonstrate the use of renewable energy in powering advanced computing systems through a scalable high-performance computing infrastructure.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400">
        By deploying a modern computing facility and addressing R&D challenges, REPACSS will explore renewable energy sources for large-scale computing. The project will study barriers, tradeoffs, and the ability to predict and schedule scientific workloads based on varied energy production, enabling significant contributions to the research community.
      </p>
